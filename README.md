### zz'bot portal

zz'bot is a lightweight, user-friendly Discord bot designed to speed up the process of getting a game going with friends.

the bot aims to streamline these processes with the following features:
- game interest registration: users can register which game modes they are interested in playing at any given time
- party creation: users can initiate a party seeking interested teammates - the bot will automatically notify any other users who have registered themselves as interested in the game. once enough players opt-in to the party (e.g. 5 players opt in to an ARAM party), the bot will notify all party members that it's time to open the game and play!
- users can view a live match summary for a specific player, including player ranks, game type, and estimated game time.

zz'bot primarily supports League of Legends, currently using the Summoner, Spectator, and League APIs to fetch live information about player matches. the interest/party systems also support other Riot games, with plans to integrate with the other APIs in the future.
